        Hey! This is <span className="font-semibold">Keshav Singhania</span>, thanks for showing interest in my <span className="italic font-semibold">ZenLudo</span> Project.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Currently, the game is under construction. There are many logic flaws in the game, and I am actively trying to fix them.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        However, you can still try playing with a friend in local game mode â€” but beware, there might be some logic errors hehehe!
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        As I am doing this project alone, it will take some time to complete. Stay connected!
      </p>
